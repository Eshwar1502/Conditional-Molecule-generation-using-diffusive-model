# Conditional Molecule generation using diffusive model 

This repository implements **Conditional Molecule generation using diffusive model** for molecular graph generation. Our model generates molecular graphs conditioned on specific chemical and pharmacological properties such as QED, logP, solubility, and more.

---

## üß† Motivation

Traditional generative models like VAEs and GANs suffer from poor reconstruction quality and mode collapse. To overcome these limitations, we explore diffusion-based models that iteratively denoise molecular graphs while being guided by target molecular properties.

Our goal is to:
- Generate high-quality molecular structures under given conditions.
- Improve molecular diversity, validity, and novelty compared to existing methods.
- Accurately condition molecule generation on desired properties like QED, logP, solubility, etc.

## üì¶ Features

- Conditional molecular generation based on 36 ADMET properties.
- Hybrid message passing blocks combining GINEConv and Transformer layers.
- Noise prediction model with property guidance.
- DPM-Solver-based sampling with configurable step size and batch size.
- Evaluation using Fr√©chet ChemNet Distance (FCD) and Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE).

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the **ZINC250k dataset**, which contains ~245,490 drug-like molecules. Molecules are represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.
